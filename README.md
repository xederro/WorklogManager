## Overview

**WorklogManager** is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) application built with Go and [Charm](https://charm.sh/), designed to simplify the process of measuring and logging time spent on JIRA tasks. This tool integrates with JIRA through the REST API (v2), allowing users to seamlessly track the time spent on tasks and log it directly into JIRA.

## Motivation

As a developer who struggled with accurately logging the time spent on various tasks in JIRA, I developed WorklogManager to address this challenge. The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, easy-to-use solution that helps track work time in a more efficient manner.

## Features

- **Track Time Spent on Tasks:** Easily start, pause, and stop timers for specific JIRA tasks.
- **Log Work Directly to JIRA:** Log the tracked time to the appropriate JIRA issues using the REST API (v2).
- **TUI Interface:** Navigate and interact with the app entirely from the terminal, using a simple and intuitive interface.

## Installation

To install WorklogManager, you need to have Go >= 1.23 installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository and build the application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xederro/WorklogManager.git
cd WorklogManager
go build
```

## Usage

Run the built executable from the terminal:

### Linux
```bash
export JIRA_URL="https://<jira_server>/rest/api/2" && export JIRA_PAT="<PAT>" && ./WorklogManager
```

### Windows
```bash
$env:JIRA_URL="https://<jira_server>/rest/api/2"; $env:JIRA_PAT="<PAT>"; ./WorklogManager.exe
```
